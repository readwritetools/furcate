### Motivation

The C language has a macro preprocessor which allows programmers to inject
xeno-language statements into their source code. This is useful because it
allows a single code base to be used for two or more targets without having to
rely on compile time or execution time conditionals.

The <span>furcate</span> utility provides a similar feature for JavaScript
source code.

### Prerequisites and installation

The <span>furcate</span> utility uses Node.js. Package installation is done
via NPM. These are the only two prerequisites.

To install the utility and make it available to your Bash shell, use this
command.

```bash
[user@host]# npm install -g furcate
```

### Usage

The software is invoked from the command line with:

```bash
[user@host]# furcate [input-file] [output-file] --defs=definitions-file
```

The input file is a regular JavaScript source code file with:

   * macro definitions
   * macro affirmative conditionals
   * macro negative conditionals
   * macro substitutions
   * comments

The definitions file contains the `#define` statements for evaluating which macro
conditional statements to keep or discard.

The macro syntax adheres to the following EBNF.

```ebnf
definition        := '#define' defName defValue
defName           := [A-Z] | [a-z] | [0-9] | '$' |'-' | '_'
defValue          := boolean | unicode-text
boolean           := 0 | false | False | FALSE | 1 | true | True | TRUE

begin affirmative := '<<' defName
end affirmative   := defName '>>'
begin negative    := '<<!' defName
end negative      := '!' defName '>>'

substitution      := '<' defName '>'

terminal-comment  := '//' unicode-text
block-comment     := '/*' unicode-text '*/'
```

Here is an example that defines HELLO and uses it in a substitution:

```furcate
#define HELLO Hola Mundo

function f(name) {
    console.log('<HELLO> ' + name);
}
```

Here is an example that defines PRO-VERSION and conditionally includes a block
of code:

```furcate
#define PRO-VERSION
<<PRO-VERSION
    var goldmine = new Bitcoin();
    goldmine.payday();
PRO-VERSION>>
```

Here is an example that defines FREE-VERSION and conditionally excludes a block
of code:

```furcate
#define FREE-VERSION
<<!FREE-VERSION
    var goldmine = new Bitcoin();
    goldmine.payday();
!FREE-VERSION>>
<<FREE-VERSION
    var poorman = new Chips();
    poorman.payday();
FREE-VERSION>>
```
